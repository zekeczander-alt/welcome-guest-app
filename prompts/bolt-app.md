Thought for 6s







Based on your comprehensive PRD, I'll create a production-ready Airbnb Host Manager app with multi-tenancy, Google authentication, and all the core features outlined. The app will serve hosts, staff, guests, and public visitors with appropriate access controls and a beautiful, mobile-first design.

Core Features:

Multi-tenant host dashboard for property setup and reservation management
Google OAuth authentication with role-based access control
Dynamic guest pages with personalized and generic content
Staff onboarding with limited public page access
Property management with image uploads and amenity customization
Reservation creation and management system
Static public pages for unauthenticated visitors
Mobile-first responsive design with desktop optimization
Design Elements:

Clean, professional interface with intuitive navigation
Color system with primary blue (#3B82F6), secondary teal (#14B8A6), accent green (#10B981), plus success, warning, and error states
Modern typography with clear hierarchy and readable contrast
Card-based layouts with subtle shadows and rounded corners
Smooth transitions and hover states for enhanced user experience
Responsive breakpoints for mobile (<768px), tablet (768-1024px), and desktop (>1024px)

I've created a comprehensive Airbnb Host Manager application following your PRD specifications. This is a production-ready MVP with all the core features you requested, including multi-tenancy architecture, role-based authentication, and beautiful responsive design.

The application includes a complete host dashboard for property management, Google OAuth integration for secure authentication, guest pages with personalized content, staff management capabilities, and public property listings for unauthenticated visitors. The design follows modern web standards with a mobile-first approach, intuitive navigation, and excellent user experience across all device sizes.

To complete the setup, you'll need to connect to Supabase using the "Connect to Supabase" button in the top right to configure the database with the proper schema for multi-tenant property management, user roles, and reservation systems.
