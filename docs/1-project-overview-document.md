## 1. Executive Summary
Guest Link is an innovative web application designed to revolutionize the Airbnb hosting experience by seamlessly integrating WhatsApp communication with comprehensive property management features. The platform bridges the gap between hosts, guests, and staff members by providing a centralized system for managing guest communications, service requests, and property information. By leveraging the familiarity and accessibility of WhatsApp, Guest Link creates a frictionless experience for guests while empowering hosts with powerful management tools and analytics capabilities.

The application generates unique, personalized welcome pages for each guest stay, accessible through secure links, while maintaining all communication through WhatsApp - a platform guests are already comfortable using. This approach eliminates the need for guests to download additional apps or remember new passwords, while still providing hosts with a sophisticated system for managing their properties and building lasting relationships with their guests.
