### How would WhatsApp integration work with this app?

1. Is it possible that the host is able to generate a temporary WhatsApp group for the guest along with the host and staff members? Customers would be able to communicate with the host and staff members through this group and place service requests.  


2. As the host checks-out from the property, host would be able to archive the conversation for their record and delete the group.

3. Host would be able to create different groups for each set of guests staying at the property that day. Creation of this group should be done during creation of Welcome Page for the guest. This unique page should have the link for the guest to join WhatsApp group created for the stay.

4. Customers would be request different services using WhatsApp chat in the group and the staff members would be able to provide the service along with the money charged for the service and if it was already paid.

5. The conversation should later be summarized by the LLM to generate the final invoice and summary of stay for the guest.
